Solving the 8-puzzle problem:

The A search algorithm is implemented in order to efficiently solve the 8-puzzle using heuristics like Manhattan distance and linear conflict to find the optimal solution. The puzzle starts in a solved state and is then randomly shuffled. The A search algorithm* explores the most promising moves first to find the fastest solution. If a solution exists, the program outputs each step and the total number of moves required. I used Manhattan Distance + Linear Conflict for better efficiency, while an optimized priority queue (heap) speeds up the search. The program generates random solvable puzzles for testing and includes a way to visualize the puzzle's state at each step. Finally, it provides a step-by-step solution (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to show how the puzzle is solved. This approach ensures an optimal and efficient path to the solution with minimal computational cost.
